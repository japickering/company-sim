##Â Welcome to Company Sim, a JavaScript web app written by me and inspired by popular American TV drama, Suits.

## Introduction
The idea came to me while I watched Suits, popular TV show Suits, on Netflix about 7 seasons worth of binge watching on an off before I got tired of the constant arguing that it reminded me of real life too much. I mused that it would make an interesting challenge to write a model that simulates the consequences of each decision taken by the characters portrayed in fictitious legal firm, Pearson Spectre.
