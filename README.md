## Legal Eagles - Hostile Takeover

## Introduction
Welcome to Legal Eagles, a JavaScript demo written by me and inspired by popular American TV drama, Suits. The idea came to me while I watched Suits on Netflix. About 7 seasons worth of binge watching on an off before I got tired of the constant arguing that it reminded me of real life too much. I mused that it would make an interesting challenge to write a model that simulates the consequences of each decision taken by the characters portrayed in fictitious legal firm, Pearson Spectre.
